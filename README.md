OberonSheet
===========
A character sheet for role-playing games.
What is OberonSheet?
--------------------
It's just an excuse for me (the developer) to practice some MongoDB and Python.

It's also a tool for role-playing game Masters and players, to get rid of those bothersome paper sheets stained with rubber marks and pencil marks.
